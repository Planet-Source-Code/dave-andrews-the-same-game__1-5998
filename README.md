## The 'Same' Game


</div>

### Description

This is a simple, but addictive game. The object is to clear the screen of all of the blocks. You may only select blocks that have neighboring blocks of the same color. This is not an original idea. I saw the game on a B&W handheld PC, and wanted to have it in color on my 'work' computer. It uses a complex sorting algorythem, which could possibly be used for sorting non-linear arrays of data.
